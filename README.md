# Linux CLI Lab Practice

This repo contains my hands on practice using the Linux command line (CLI).  
I followed a lab that covered core BASH commands and terminal operations.

## 🔧 What I Practiced

- Navigating file systems with `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
- Creating, editing, copying, moving, and deleting files
- Viewing file contents with `cat`, `more`, and `less`
- Searching with `grep` and `find`
- Sorting, filtering, and counting with pipes (`|`), `sort`, `uniq`, and `wc`

## 📁 Files Included

- `notes.md` - Personal notes 
- `linux cli certificate.pdf` - Proof of course completion from Cybrary
