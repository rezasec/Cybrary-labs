# 🐧 Linux Lab Practice

This repo contains my hands on practice using the Linux command line (CLI) and the Linux file system.  
I followed a series of labs that covered core BASH commands, terminal operations, and system directory structure.

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

- Navigating file systems with `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
- Creating, editing, copying, moving, and deleting files
- Viewing file contents with `cat`, `more`, and `less`
- Searching with `grep` and `find`
- Understanding file permissions (`ls -l`, `drwxr-xr-x`)
- Exploring system directories like `/etc`, `/var/log`, `/usr`, and `/proc`
- Creating users and inspecting their home directories
- Sorting, filtering, and counting with pipes (`|`), `sort`, `uniq`, and `wc`
- Monitoring live logs with `tail -f` and inspecting disk usage with `df`, `lsblk`, `fdisk`
