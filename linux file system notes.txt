This is a summary of the key concepts and commands I practiced during the Linux File System Basics guided lab on Cybrary.

🔍 Exploring the Linux File System
Used cd / to navigate to the root of the file system.

Ran ls -l to display directories and symbolic links under root.

Learned that:

d means it's a directory (e.g., /home, /etc).

l means it's a symbolic link (shortcut).

rwx characters represent read, write, and execute permissions.

🌲 Tree Structure Navigation
tree / -L 1: Viewed the root directory one level deep.

tree /home: Showed all home directories.

sudo adduser michael: Created a new user, saw it got a new home folder.

📁 Key Directories and Their Roles
/etc: Stores system configuration files (e.g., hosts, fstab, crontab).

/var/log: Holds system logs (syslog, auth.log, dmesg, etc).

/usr: Stores shared user tools, binaries, libraries, and documentation.

/opt: Reserved for third-party software.

/dev: Represents devices as files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/xvda).

/mnt: Used for mounting external devices (CD, USB, NFS).

/root: Home directory for the root user.

/proc: Temporary virtual filesystem showing running processes.

/boot: Contains files needed for system boot.

📊 Disk & Storage Management
sudo fdisk -l | grep dev | grep -v loop: Lists physical drives.

sudo df -h: Shows partition usage in human-readable form.

lsblk: Lists block devices with sizes and mount points.

🛠️ Helpful Log and Monitoring Commands
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog: Monitors real-time system logs.

sudo last: Reads login history from the lastlog file.

sudo who: Shows currently logged-in users.
