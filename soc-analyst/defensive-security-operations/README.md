# Defensive Security Operations

In this module I focused on the core operational aspects of defensive cybersecurity, particularly continuous monitoring within a Security Operations Center (SOC). It covered the roles, technologies, and alert handling logic SOC analysts use daily.

## Key Topics Covered

- SOC roles: Analyst, Engineer, Manager, Responder, Threat Hunter, etc.
- Foundational security tools: Firewall, AV, EDR, IDS/IPS, VPN, SIEM
- Continuous monitoring and alert triage workflow
- Alert types:
  - **Signature-based**
  - **Anomaly-based**
  - **Correlation-based**
- True/False Positive & False Negative logic
- Alert adjudication and detection tuning

##  Skills Practiced

- Understanding security alert classifications
- Mapping detection methods to tools (SIEM, IDS, EDR, etc.)
- Evaluating alerts based on behavior and signatures
- Adjudicating security events as true/false positives
