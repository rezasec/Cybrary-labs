## ðŸªŸ Windows CLI Basics

In this lab I covered essential command line skills for navigating and managing a Windows system using `cmd.exe`. It was split into three parts:

### ðŸ”¹ Navigation
- Opened PowerShell with admin rights and switched to `cmd` for CLI practice.
- Learned how to use `cd`, `dir`, and `tree` to navigate directories.
- Explored the `help` command and used switches like `/s` and `/p` for extended directory listing and pagination.

### ðŸ”¹ File Operations
- Created, renamed, copied, and moved files using commands like `mkdir`, `echo`, `type`, `copy`, `rename`, `move`, and `del`.
- Practiced piping with `|` and filtering using `findstr`.
- Learned about wildcards (`*`), redirection (`>` vs. `>>`), and safe deletion (`del /p`).
- Explored how to build and remove nested directories using `mkdir` and `rmdir /s`.

### ðŸ”¹ System Administration
- Used `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, `sc query`, and `net` commands for gathering system data.
- Counted user accounts and groups using `find /c`.
- Ran a ping sweep using a `for` loop to identify live hosts in the network.
- Used `ipconfig`, `nslookup`, `ping`, and `netstat -ant` for basic networking operations.
