# Cryptography Basics

This section focuses on how plaintext is transformed into ciphertext using ciphers and cryptographic keys.

##  Key Concepts
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Transforming readable data into unreadable form and vice versa.
- **Cipher**: The algorithm used to encrypt/decrypt data.
- **Key**: The value that drives the cipher logic.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A basic shift cipher used to demonstrate core ideas.
- **Cryptanalysis**: The method of breaking encrypted messages 

##  Lab Summary
Used a Python program `caesar.py` to:
- Encrypt the message `Bring Caesar a Salad!` using key `5`.
- Decrypt it with the same key.
