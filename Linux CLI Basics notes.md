ðŸ§ª Lab Notes: Linux CLI Basics
Completed a hands on guided lab covering fundamental Linux command-line operations. This was my first real practice session working directly in the terminal, and it helped solidify key concepts.

âœ… Key Commands and Concepts Practiced:
Identified user and system info with: whoami, hostname, pwd, and id

Navigated directories with: cd, cd .., pwd, ls

Understood output of ls -l, including file permissions like drwxr-xr-x

Created directories with mkdir and files with touch

Appended text using echo and viewed content with cat

Copied and moved files using cp and mv

Removed files safely using rm -i

Used more and less to view large files interactively

Created large test files with: base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 1M > abigfile.txt

Searched for files with find and content inside files with grep

Combined commands using pipes | with sort, uniq, and wc for text parsing

This experience gave me a practical foundation in using the terminal efficiently and built my confidence with Linux file operations.
