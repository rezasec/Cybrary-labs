Linux CLI Lab â€“ Guided Practice

Just finished a full guided Linux terminal lab. Here's what I learned and practiced step by step:

Used basic commands like whoami, hostname, pwd, and id

Navigated directories using cd, cd .., and confirmed with ls

Understood what ls -l shows, like file permissions and what drwxr-xr-x actually means

Created folders with mkdir and made empty files using touch

Added text to files using echo, and viewed contents using cat

Learned the difference between copying (cp) and moving/renaming files (mv)

Practiced removing files with rm -i safely

Played with more and less to scroll through big files

Created a 1MB random file using a single powerful line (base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 1M > abigfile.txt)

Used find to search for files by name, and grep to search for text inside files

Combined commands using pipes (|) to sort, filter, and count file content with sort, uniq, wc, etc.

This was my first real hands on Linux CLI lab, and it actually made a lot of concepts click for me. More confident now with navigating and managing files through the terminal.
